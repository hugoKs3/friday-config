## OUTPUT FORMATS

These are the available output formats for Speedtest CLI specified with the **-f** or **--format** flags. All machine readable formats 
(csv, tsv, json, jsonl, json-pretty) use bytes for data sizes, bytes per seconds for speeds and milliseconds for durations. They also always use maximum precision output.

## UNITS OF MEASURE

For the human-readable output format, you can specify the unit of measure to use. The default unit 
is <Mbps>. The supported units are listed below. 

These units do not apply to machine readable output formats (json, jsonl, csv and tsv).

### Decimal options (multipliers of 1000)

* **bps**:
  bits per second

* **MB/s**:
 megabytes per second
* **GB/s**:
  gigabytes per second
 
### Binary options (multipliers of 1024)
* **kibps**:
  kibibits per second
* **Mibps**:
  mebibits per second
* **Gibps**:
  gibibits per second
* **kiB/s**:
  kibibytes per second
* **MiB/s**:
  mebibytes per second
* **GiB/s**:
  gibibytes per second

### Auto-scaling options
Automatic units will scale the prefix depending on the measured speed. 

* **auto-decimal-bits**:
  automatic in decimal bits
* **auto-decimal-bytes**:
  automatic in decimal bytes
* **auto-binary-bits**:
  automatic in binary bits
* **auto-binary-bytes**:

through a command line interface on a personal computer.  Your use of this software is subject to the End User

## OUTPUT
Upon successful execution, the application will exit with an exit code of 0. The result will include
latency, jitter, download, upload, packet loss (where available), and a result URL.

Latency and jitter will be represented in milliseconds. Download and upload units will depend on the output
format as well as if a unit was specified. The human-readable format defaults to Mbps and any machine-readable
formats (csv, tsv, json, jsonl, json-pretty) use bytes as the unit of measure with max precision. Packet loss is represented as a percentage, or **Not available** when packet loss is unavailable in the executing network environment.

The bytes per second measurements can be transformed into the human-readable output format
default unit of megabits (Mbps) by dividing the bytes per second value by 125,000.  For example:

38404104 bytes per second = 38404104 / 125 = 307232.832 kilobits per second = 307232.832 / 1000 = 307.232832 megabits per second

The value 125 is derived from 1000 / 8 as follows:

1 byte = 8 bits
1 kilobit = 1000 bits

38404104 bytes per second = 38404104 * 8 bits per byte = 307232832 bits per second = 307232832 / 1000 bits per kilobit = 307232.832 kilobits per second

The Result URL is available to share your result, appending **.png** to the Result URL will create a
shareable result image.

*Example human-readable result:*

## NETWORK TIMEOUT VALUES
By default, network requests set a timeout of **10** seconds. The only exception to this
is latency testing, which sets a timeout of **15** seconds.

## FATAL ERRORS
Upon fatal errors, the application will exit with a non-zero exit code.

**Initialization Fatal Error Examples:**

*Configuration - Couldn't connect to server (Network is unreachable)*

*Configuration - Could not retrieve or read configuration (ConfigurationError)*

**Stage Execution Fatal Error Example:**

*[error] Error: [1] Latency test failed for HTTP*

*[error] Error: [36] Cannot open socket: Operation now in progress*

*[error] Failed to resolve host name. Cancelling test suite.*

*[error] Host resolve failed: Exec format error*

*[error] Cannot open socket: No route to host*

*[error] Server Selection - Failed to find a working test server. (NoServers)*

## SSL CERTIFICATE LOCATIONS
By default the following paths are checked for CA certificate bundles on linux machines:

    /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
    /etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt
    /usr/share/ssl/certs/ca-bundle.crt
    /usr/local/share/certs/ca-root-nss.crt
    /etc/ssl/cert.pem

If the device under test does *not* have one of the above mentioned files, then the canonical and up to date CA certificate bundle provided by the curl project can be manually
downloaded into a specific location.  This specific location can be provided as a parameter per the following example:

    wget https://curl.se/ca/cacert.pem
    ./ookla --ca-certificate=./cacert.pem
