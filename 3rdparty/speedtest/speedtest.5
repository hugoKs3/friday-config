.SH "OUTPUT"
Upon successful execution, the application will exit with an exit code of 0\. The result will include latency, jitter, download, upload, packet loss (where available), and a result URL\.
.
.P
Latency and jitter will be represented in milliseconds\. Download and upload units will depend on the output format as well as if a unit was specified\. The human\-readable format defaults to Mbps and any machine\-readable formats (csv, tsv, json, jsonl, json\-pretty) use bytes as the unit of measure with max precision\. Packet loss is represented as a percentage, or \fBNot available\fR when packet loss is unavailable in the executing network environment\.
.
.P
The bytes per second measurements can be transformed into the human\-readable output format default unit of megabits (Mbps) by dividing the bytes per second value by 125,000\. For example:
.
.P
38404104 bytes per second = 38404104 / 125 = 307232\.832 kilobits per second = 307232\.832 / 1000 = 307\.232832 megabits per second
.
.P
The value 125 is derived from 1000 / 8 as follows:
.
.P
1 byte = 8 bits 1 kilobit = 1000 bits
.
.P
38404104 bytes per second = 38404104 * 8 bits per byte = 307232832 bits per second = 307232832 / 1000 bits per kilobit = 307232\.832 kilobits per second
.
.P
The Result URL is available to share your result, appending \fB\.png\fR to the Result URL will create a shareable result image\.
